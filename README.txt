numpy==1.23.4
opencv_python==4.6.0.66

2. How to run each task and where to look for the output file

All tasks are integrated into the 'main.py' script. Just run the script and a directory named '352_Bejenariu_David_Cosmin' containing the output files should be generated. 
Please note that the 'points.py' script, 'antrenare', 'imagini_auxiliare' and 'testare' sub-folders should be in the same folder as the 'main.py' script.
